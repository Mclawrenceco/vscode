[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft-specific customizations, released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).

VS Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with essential features for the core edit-build-debug cycle. It offers:

- Comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding
- Lightweight debugging
- A rich extensibility model
- Seamless integration with existing tools

VS Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for [Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). For the latest daily updates, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support, such as code completion or Go to Definition, have the suffix `language-features`. For example:

- `json`: Provides coloring for `JSON`
- `json-language-features`: Provides rich language support for `JSON`

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

### Getting Started with Dev Containers

- For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to create a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  - If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

- For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

> **Note:** The Docker / Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run a full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.
